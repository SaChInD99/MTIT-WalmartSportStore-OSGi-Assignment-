# MTIT-WalmartSportStore-OSGi-Assignment-
Using the Eclipse Equinox OSGi Framework, we created a system for the Sports accessories shop. There are many various sports equipment offered at Walmart Sports Accessories, including bats, balls, gloves, racquets, clubs, helmets, skis, fishing gear, workout equipment, table games, souvenirs, and licensed goods. When multiple consumer bundles are developed, they will all behave identically, which is a duplicate implementation of consumer bundles, which is why there should only be one consumer. Eclipse was the IDE in use, and it was written in the Java programming language. 

• To offer their goods to their customers, the Sports Manager, Shop cashier, Shop Storekeeper, Company Supplier, and Delivery Person collaborate in this Walmart Sports accessories store. Among them we select only four functions, and they are Manager, Supplier, Delivery person and Storekeeper. 
• In this situation, there are four consumers and four producers, including a manager consumer, a supplier consumer, a storekeeper consumer, and a transport consumer. 
• Sports accessories will be supplied to the store by the Supplier Consumer, who will also mark the price and provide discounts on the products. 
•  The storekeeper's customer will increase and decrease the quantities of each item in stock.  • Delivery costs are calculated by the transport consumer based on the location and distance of the delivery.  
• We expose the producer service APIs to follow OSGI standard practices.
